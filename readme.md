# **ESLint and Prettier setup for VS Code**

- A set of awesome ESLint + Prettier configs.
- Makes it easier to work with React, Next.js, Node apps.
- This package is intended for use with VS Code, however, can be easily used with any text editors.

> This package will automatically detect if you're using React, Next.js, Node (and other in near future), and apply appropriate linting rules. üëåüèº

# **Installation**

> ### **You may need to restart VSCode once installed.**

First installation will take you only a couple of minute, every subsequent should not take more than a minute.

You can install the package 2.a) in repo of the project which will apply the linting only to the project and not other files on your computer or 2.b) on your computer which will apply the linting to all files with the included file extensions on your computer.

Below are the steps to install (click on the step to open the instructions).
